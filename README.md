Overview

The Home SIEM Lab Project is a self-contained environment designed for learning, experimenting, and practicing with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. This project provides an opportunity to explore cybersecurity concepts such as log collection, event correlation, threat detection, and alert management in a controlled and scalable environment. Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, a student, or a professional, this lab will help deepen your understanding of SIEM systems and their applications.

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

Understanding SIEM Concepts: Learn the core functionalities of SIEM systems, including log aggregation, event correlation, and alerting.

Hands-On Practice: Set up a home lab with realistic scenarios for detecting and analyzing potential threats.

Skill Development: Improve your skills in log analysis, threat detection, and incident response.

Tool Familiarity: Gain experience with popular open-source and commercial SIEM solutions.

Features

Log Collection and Aggregation: Collect logs from multiple devices (e.g., Linux servers, Windows machines, network devices).

Event Correlation: Configure correlation rules to identify patterns of malicious activity.

Dashboard Visualization: Use interactive dashboards to visualize security events and system health.

Alerting: Receive real-time alerts based on predefined rules and thresholds.

Threat Hunting: Simulate and detect threats such as brute-force attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized access.

Components

This lab includes the following components:

SIEM Platform:

Example: Wazuh (EDR+SIEM).

Optional: Splunk (free tier for limited data ingestion).

Log Sources:

Syslogs from Linux and Windows systems.

Firewall and router logs.

Web server logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

Virtual Environment:

VirtualBox, VMware, or any other virtualization tool to host the environment.

Multiple virtual machines simulating servers, endpoints, and network devices.

Network Simulations:

Tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, or custom scripts to simulate attacks.

Vulnerable machines (e.g., DVWA, Metasploitable) for testing.

Optional Integrations:

Threat intelligence feeds.

Incident response playbooks.

Requirements

Hardware:

At least 16GB of RAM (recommended for virtualization).

100GB+ of storage.

Multi-core processor.

Software:

Virtualization tool (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware).

Operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows Server).

SIEM platform (e.g., ELK Stack, Security Onion).

Setup Instructions

Prepare Your Environment:

Install a virtualization tool (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware).

Set up virtual machines for log sources and SIEM components.

Deploy the SIEM:

Install and configure the SIEM platform of your choice.

Set up Logstash or equivalent to ingest logs from various sources.

Configure dashboards in Kibana or the SIEMâ€™s visualization tool.

Configure Log Sources:

Enable and forward logs from Linux and Windows machines.

Set up syslog or filebeat agents for log forwarding.

Simulate Security Scenarios:

Use tools like Metasploit or Kali Linux to generate security events.

Create benign and malicious activity to observe SIEM responses.

Analyze and Refine:

Monitor dashboards and alerts.

Adjust correlation rules and thresholds as needed.

Use Cases

Monitor and analyze system and network activity.

Detect and respond to simulated security incidents.

Develop and test custom SIEM rules.

Practice incident response workflows.

Future Enhancements

Integration with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms.

Addition of threat intelligence feeds for enriched detection capabilities.

Deployment of honeypots to gather additional insights.

Implementation of advanced machine learning models for anomaly detection.
